# Pitney Bowes_Data Science_Challenge_2021
Practicing on the PB practice data set for the upcoming challenge

## Background
1. [Pitney Bowes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitney_Bowes) is one of the leaders in the Mailing meters space.
2. Mailing meters allow businesses to be more productive by simplifying their mailing and shipping.
3. We offer leased hardware, as-well as SaaS solutions.
4. Our clients must be able to rely on our meters to function to meet their customers’ needs.

## Problem Statement
- Pitney Bowes uses predictive maintenance to reduce the risk of down-times of meters deployed at our clients’ offices.
- Since our meters are part of our clients’ business operations, we must be proactive about identifying potential problems early on to avoid any sort of disruption for our clients.
- Predictive maintenance allows us to have the required replacement parts where they are needed, and to proactively schedule an appointment with our customers if needed.
- The meters are Cloud-connected, which allows us to monitor the health of a device and detect potential problems early on.
- For this challenge, we generated a training sample for ~40k meters. You are asked to build a model that can predict which meters will fail within the next 7 days.

## Solution Requirements
1. A csv file with the meter id and the [fail_7 column forecast](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/PB_Challenge_2021/blob/main/Submission_prediction_result_devices.csv) for the meters in the test set.
2. [Python notebook](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/PB_Challenge_2021/blob/main/PB_Challenge_2021_Team2.ipynb) with code and sufficient documentation.
3. Single page [poster](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/PB_Challenge_2021/blob/main/Lean%20canvas_PB%20Challenge_Team2.pdf) summarizing work done and techniques implemented which will be used for presentation on the final day.
4. [Video](https://vimeo.com/542479668) presentation for the work done.

## Additional Exercise: Design Thinking
**Problem:** Consumers complain about device failures that had been installed months ago.
- Reason 1:
  * Unable to idenitfy device failures in advance.
- Reason 2:
  * Not enough data to make a prediction to detect meters that may fail tomorrow.
- Reason 3:
  * Data is available but engineering team designated to fix is not communicated.
- Reason 4:
  * Data and engineering team is aware, but consumer hasn't responded or been pro-active about their meters.
- Reason 5:
  * Lack of awareness that the device installed in the past needs maintenance.
   * [x] Root cause
